### Project README: Uber Price Optimization

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the pricing strategy for Uber rides using data science techniques. The main objective is to analyze historical ride data, identify key factors influencing ride prices, and build predictive models to suggest optimal pricing strategies. The project leverages Python and various data science libraries, and it is deployed using Streamlit for interactive exploration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-price-optimization.git
   cd uber-price-optimization
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Description

The project uses a dataset containing information about Uber rides, including:

- **Pickup Location:** Latitude and Longitude
- **Dropoff Location:** Latitude and Longitude
- **Distance:** Distance of the trip
- **Time of Day:** The hour of the ride
- **Day of Week:** The day of the week
- **Weather Conditions:** Weather during the ride
- **Surge Multiplier:** Surge pricing multiplier
- **Ride Fare:** The actual fare of the ride

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA notebook (`eda.ipynb`) includes detailed visualizations and statistical analyses to understand:

- Correlations between ride distance, time, weather, and fare.
- Distribution of fares across different times and locations.
- Patterns in surge pricing.

## Modeling

The modeling notebook (`modeling.ipynb`) includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
2. **Model Selection:** Comparison of various regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict ride fares.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization using Grid Search or Randomized Search.
4. **Evaluation:** Performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

## Results

The final model suggests optimal pricing strategies by considering factors like demand, time, distance, and weather conditions. Detailed results, including the model's performance on test data, are discussed in the results section of the modeling notebook.

## Streamlit App Deployment

### How the Streamlit App Works

The project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. The app allows users to:

- **Visualize Data:** Users can explore different visualizations based on the Uber ride data.
- **Predict Fares:** Users can input ride parameters (pickup location, dropoff location, time, etc.) to predict the fare using the optimized model.
- **Simulate Pricing Strategies:** Users can adjust pricing parameters and see how it affects the predicted fare.

### Streamlit Deployment Steps

1. **Install Streamlit:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Deploy to a cloud platform:**

   - **Heroku Deployment:**
     - Create a `Procfile` with the following content:
       ```
       web: streamlit run app.py
       ```
     - Push your code to Heroku using Git.

   - **Other platforms:** Similar steps can be followed for deploying on other platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Usage

Once deployed, the Streamlit app can be accessed via a web browser. Users can interact with the app by selecting ride features and viewing predicted prices in real-time.
